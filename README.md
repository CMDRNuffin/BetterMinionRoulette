# BetterMinionRoulette
Better minion roulette plugin for FFXIV (pretty much a 1-to-1 copy of my other plugin - BetterMountRoulette)

Allows for a more granular approach to selecting the minions you want included in your mount roulette instead of the very binary "up to 30" and "EVERYTHING!!!!" options the game gives us.

## Known Bugs
None currently. Yay.

## Roadmap
Things I intend to implement at some point in the future. Before posting a feature request, please make sure it's not already listed here:

- Group minions to treat as a single minion. Got 85 different flavours of "ball" but only the wind-up cursor otherwise? Put the balls in a group and treat it as a single minion for a 50/50 chance of getting "a random ball" or the cursor.
- Customizable rarities (for when you like some minions less than others, but not enough to disable them outright)
